Go to `https://acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/multi_omic_benchmark/download.html` to download the multi-omics benchmark datasets. Place the downloaded datasets in this `shamir_data` folder. The directory structure should look like this:
```
shamir_data/Multi_Omics_Cancer_Benchmark_TCGA_Shamir/<dataset_name>/
```

Furthermore, to map the methylation probe IDs to gene symbols, download the file from `https://webdata.illumina.com/downloads/productfiles/humanmethylation450/humanmethylation450_15017482_v1-2.csv` and place it in the `shamir_data` folder named as `methylation_gene_mapping.csv`.
